Capstone Requirements

 Week 21

Purpose: to outline and agree on your capstone MVP.
Preparation for this meeting:
User stories
tickets
Project ERD
wireframes
personal biosite COMPLETED
Completed wireframes
A github project with your application planned out - cards written by feature, lots of detail in each card
Some sample JSON that matches your ERD - put this in a data ticket
(If using an API) A working API get request. If you plan to use another API you need to demonstrate the ability to connect to this API and return data back. Use the react-setup project we made. Add a component with an axios call to demonstrate that you are able to hit your API and return back the data you need. NO EXTENSIONS in time will be granted for this. If you do not have a working API call on this date then use of your API will be a stretch goal and not part of your MVP.

At the end of this meeting you should have:

A list of your MVP goals
An ordered list of your stretch goals
A set of goals to complete by your next meeting

ðŸ’» Technical Requirements:
React
Firebase CRUD
Bootstrap/Reactstrap/Styled Components
Deployed Site (Firebase or Netlify)
It is NOT required to use an external API.

ðŸ“… Planning:
Use Github Projects for planning
Create wireframes (use whatever tool you want - moqups, lucid charts, photoshop, adobe XD, Figma, etc.)
If you are using an external API, gather all sample data and be prepared to demo your api at your first check in (via Postman and a couple of endpoints in a codesandbox) before committing to use the API.
If you have not fleshed out your planning enough, your capstone mentor will not let you code.

ðŸ“„ Documentation:
A completed README with details and deployment link.
README is completed with:
Name of the Project
Overview of the project
Link to your wireframes/prototype
Link to the deployed project
Link to your project board (yes...even though it is a part of the repo)
Description of the user
List of features
Screenshots of your project
List of contributors and links to their GH profiles
Link to Loom video walkthrough of your app (no more than 1 minute long! Make it great)
Also include the link to your deployed Personal Bio Site on the README.

Deploying on Netlify
